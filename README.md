# Working with the Adventure Works Databases

This repository contains code used in tutorials using the Adventure Works OLTP
and OLAP databases. These tutorials are posted as blog posts on
[my website](https://dlwhittenbury.github.io/).

## AW-1: Obtaining, Loading and Querying Adventure Works Database

This is the very first in a series of tutorials utilising Microsoft's Adventure
Works database samples. The focus of these tutorials will be on database and
analytics concepts and software. In particular, we will look at performing
queries and other important tasks with SQL Server Management Studio, interacting
with databases with python, creating Power BI reports and many other topics.

## AW-2: Querying Adventure Works Database with Python

In this tutorial we will query the SQL Server database AdventureWorksDW2017 with
python. We will do this by using [pyodbc](https://pypi.org/project/pyodbc/)
which is an open source Python module that makes accessing ODBC databases very
simple.
